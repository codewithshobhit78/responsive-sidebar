# responsive-sidebar
 i am Creat a responsive sidebar is an essential part of modern web design, allowing for a seamless user experience across various devices. In this project, we will implement a sidebar using HTML and CSS that adjusts its layout based on the screen size. The sidebar will contain navigation links, which will be displayed in a vertical list on larger screens and transform into a collapsible menu on smaller screens. We will utilize CSS Flexbox for layout management and media queries to ensure the sidebar remains functional and visually appealing on both desktops and mobile devices. By the end of this project, users will have a fully responsive sidebar that enhances navigation and accessibility on any device
